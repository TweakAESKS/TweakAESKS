This folder contains all the code used for the (Tweaked) Simulated Annealing algorithm.

To use it, you need to obtain both Minizinc (http://www.minizinc.org/index.html) and Gecode (http://www.gecode.org/).

Then simply using
make search
./search
will launch the algorithm (expect about ~30min of precomputation before the actual start)

The search.cpp file can be edited (at the beginning of the main) to changes the parameters as follow :

- Pk is the initial permutation to use to start the algorithm. 
- Ps is the permutation to use for the ShiftRows operation
- T is the initial temperature (T0) for the algorithm
- beta is a parameter used in the coolign schedule function alpha
- bound_active is the targeted length
- activeK is a parameter for the quicksearch algorithm (function NoPathsNoEq). It controls the maximal number of active bytes in the key that the NoPathsNoEq function will use to (quickly) search for a relatively short (and valid) path.
- n_rounds is the number of rounds to consider
